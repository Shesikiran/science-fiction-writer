Built a model to mimic the writings of Jules Verne and predicted the text using the character-level RNN and word-level RNN which also included generalizing the RNN with LSTM units which uses novels as datasets and achieved an accuracy gain of ~85%

Task-1

In this task I took three novels of jules verne and combined it and preprocessed the input with character level encoding and inputted to vanilla RNN and trained the data and the predicted output with the charater-level using vanilla-RNN is give in the report.

Task-2 

same as the Task-1 but the training is done with RNN that has LSTM units and the difference and accuracy gain and other properties are show in the report

Task-3

In this task the preprocessing of the data is done by word-level and encoded and tarined the data using the Vanilla-RNN and predicted the output text word-level
